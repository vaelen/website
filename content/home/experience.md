I led a team of software engineers who worked on various internal systems related to The Boon Group's business as a third party insurance administrator. These systems were written in C# and ran on the Microsoft Windows platform with SQL Server databases.

The majority of my work involved managing team members, improving development processes, working on build, continuous integration, and deployment systems, managing ticket workflows, producing documentation, mentoring engineers, producing training materials, interfacing with customers, resolving conflicts within the team, holding one-on-one meetings with team members, generating reports for our executives, producing staffing and employee development plans, and other leadership tasks.

I also developed code in C# as needed. Some of these applications were web based systems with SQL Server databases, some were standalone or console applications that ran back-end processing.

I implemented several process improvements that greatly improved productivity. Some examples included implementing an agile Scrum "lite" development process, setting up continuous integration and testing, building staging environments, and restructuring the team to better support our business needs.

Applications I configured and managed included Jira, Confluence, Stash (git), Bamboo, Mattermost, and Octopus. I also performed system administration tasks as needed on Windows, Linux, and OpenVMS systems.
