abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore the effect that selectional preferences have on the accuracy of semantic role labeling systems in a controlled environment where other unseen factors will not affect the outcome. This will provide evidence either for or against the inclusion of selectional preferences as a standard feature of semantic role labeling systems in the future.

summary: My undergraduate honors thesis in the field of natural language processing and semantic analysis.
