title: "First Release of Japanese Dependency Vectors"
---
At the end of last semester I finished the first version of Japanese Dependency Vectors (jpdv).Â  I had to give up on using Clojure at the last minute because it was taking me too long to make progress and I needed to have some sort of a working system to turn in for my NLP final project.

To accomplish this I rewrote jpdv in Java.Â  It took me about 18 hours of solid coding, minus time for food of course. î—

The software can now generate both context-based and dependency-based vector spaces for Japanese text that has been pre-parsed with CaboCha.Â  It can also generate a similarity matrix for a given vector space using the cosine similarity measurement.Â  I still need to add a path selection function to throw out paths that are too long and a basis element selection function that determines which N basis elements to keep out of all those discovered, but I will add those to the next release.Â  I'm thinking of writing the path selection and basis element selection functions as <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> scripts so that they can be supplied at run time.Â  This would allow for better customization of the system at run time for a given task.

More information can be found <a href="http://vaelen.org/software/jpdv/">here</a> and on the <a href="http://github.com/vaelen/jpdv" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.

Here is an example similarity matrix generated by the current version of jpdv:
